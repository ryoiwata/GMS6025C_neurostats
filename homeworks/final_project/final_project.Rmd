## Basic demographics (age, gender, education) 
## Duration of sobriety prior to treatment

## Specific SUDs (e.g., alcohol use disorder)

## Stressful Life Experiences (LEC-5) lec.damon
"
*The structure of this dataframe is really bonkers. You probably want to use the variable “toyou_total” which is a sum of event types that the patients endorsed as having happened to them. We sometimes also use “toyou_wit_total”, which is a similar sum score, but includes events that have happened to the participant AND events that the participant has witnessed.
